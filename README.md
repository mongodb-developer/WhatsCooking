<h1 align="center">What's Cooking with Atlas Search</h1>

<h2 align="center">A Restaurant Finder Application Demo MongoDB Atlas Search</h2>
<p>Hello! ðŸ‘‹ This application allows you to search lightning fast through over 25,000 restaurants in the New York city area based on a variety of search parameters and data types:</p>
<ul>
<li>restaurant name</li>
<li>geolocation coordinates</li>
<li>cuisine type</li>
<li>average star rating</li>
<li>borough</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<div align="center">
<img src="restaurantDemo.gif" width="450"  />
</div>
<br/>
<p><em>Note: This dataset is mocked. Please do not use to make actual dining decisions.</em></p>

<p> What's Cooking implements many Atlas Search features from autocomplete to custom function scoring. Using the $search operator in a MongoDB aggregation pipeline, we can build fine-grained searches across text, numerics, and geospatial data. By building out What's Cooking, you'll learn all sorts of ways MongoDB allows you to build complex, fine-grained full-text searches on your Atlas data.</p>

**No additional servers or software needed. No need to keep data in sync. Everything is done in MongoDB Atlas.**

- fuzzy matching
- highlighting
- autocomplete
- range queries
- geoqueries
- facets
- relevance-based scoring
- custom function scoring
- synonyms

<p>Check out the video of the MongoDB .Live keynote to see a demonstration of all the features or visit the link below to play around with the finished application, hosted entirely in MongoDB Atlas:</p>
<h2 align="center"><a href="https://www.atlassearchrestaurants.com">www.atlassearchrestaurants.com</a></h2>

<p>This application is hosted entirely by MongoDB Atlas was created using:</p>

- React
- Tailwind CSS
- MongoDB Realm for backend HTTPs endpoints and webhooks
- A modified sample dataset based on MongoDB's Atlas sample_restaurants dataset

- A recent version of Node.js and npm.
- Restaurant sample dataset.
- Synonyms dataset.
- (Recommended) <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass">MongoDB Compass - GUI</a>

<p>You can read and download the dataset using the MongoDB Shell, any MongoDB driver, or my favorite MongoDB Compass using the following URI:</p>

<h2>Using Realm as Your Serverless Backend....</h2>
<p>What's Cooking uses HTTP services in Realm to create 5 APIs to allow you to query for your restaurant data over HTTP: </p>

- `GetRestaurantsEndPoint` called from the `useHomeFetch.js` hook.
- `GetFacetsEndpoint` called from the `useHomeFetch.js` hook.
- `Suggestions_AC_Endpoint` called from the `SearchBar.js` component.
- `getSynonyms` called in the `SynonymsPage.js`.
